# :two_hearts: Skylar Shaffer

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with team management experience from my years in IT. I specialize in serverless applications and I find API vulnerabilities in my free time. I am especially passionate about the LEGO system and my goal is to better encompass and standardize how we understand it.

## :computer: RN

Iâ€™m currently working on:
- A novel GraphQL introspection exploit
- brickinfo: A Chrome Extension that injects advanced pricing information for LEGO bricks when browsing LEGO shopping websites
- brickquery: A querying React application that automates Bricklink Wanted List creation and maintenance
- brickapi: A fresh approach to brick database and APIs that seeks to solve the "subjectivity" problem with unique, flexible, objective, and consistent nested variants.
