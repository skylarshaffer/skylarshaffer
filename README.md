# :two_hearts: Skylar Shaffer

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and recent bootcamp graduate with team management experience from my years in IT. I specialize in serverless React applications and security research.

When I am not coding, I am sorting LEGO or finding API vulnerabilities and I am happiest when my focus is shifting as frequently as possible. My loftiest goal is to create the end-all LEGO part classification system.

## :computer: RN

Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [brickinfo](https://github.com/skylarshaffer/brickinfo): A Chrome Extension that injects advanced pricing information for LEGO bricks when browsing LEGO shopping websites.
- brickquery: A querying React application that automates Bricklink Wanted List creation and maintenance.
- brickapi: A fresh approach to brick database and APIs that seeks to solve the "subjectivity" problem with unique, flexible, objective, and consistent nested variants.
- [graph-test](https://github.com/skylarshaffer/graph-test): A tool for testing for GraphQL vulnerabilities by domain. Currently full-stack, attempting to migrate to serverless.
- A novel GraphQL introspection exploit.
- greeblify: A 2D graphic generator that creates brick greeble on the fly.

Bootcamp Project:
- [alterplates](https://github.com/skylarshaffer/alterplates): A front-end application for generating vanity license plate suggestions.
